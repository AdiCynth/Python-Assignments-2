# Task: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

## Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Uses a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from **1 to 50**.
2. Calculates the **sum** of all integers in this range.
3. Displays the **final sum**.

## Code Description:
The program initializes a variable `total` to zero, then uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 50 (inclusive). Each number is added to `total`. Finally, the program prints the total sum.

## Expected Output:
When you run the program, the output should be:
